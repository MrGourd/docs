You can create a VPC endpoint using your domain in your VPC and use this VPC endpoint to connect to a VPC endpoint service that is created using another domain in another VPC.

The two VPCs must be in the same region.

Before creating a VPC endpoint, you need to provide your own domain ID and have it added to the whitelist of the VPC endpoint service in the required format.
