VPCEP provides:

-   **High-speed cloudification**

    Connect your local data center to cloud services using a Virtual Private Network \(VPN\) connection or a direct connection over an internal network to improve access efficiency and security and reduce costs.

    [Figure 1](#fig20412453115613)  shows the application details.

-   **Cross-VPC connection**

    Different VPCs cannot communicate with each other. To solve this problem, you can create an application in your VPC and configure it as a VPC endpoint service. A VPC endpoint can be created in another VPC of the same region and then used as a channel to access the VPC endpoint service.

    [Figure 2](#fig8413145311561)  shows the application details.
