# Managing Active Clusters<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0125375560"></a>

After an MRS cluster is created, you can view basic information and patch information about the clusters and the cluster management page.

-   **[Viewing Basic Information About an Active Cluster](viewing-basic-information-about-an-active-cluster.md)**  
After clusters are created, you can monitor and manage clusters. Choose  **Clusters \> Active Clusters**. Select a cluster and click its name to switch to the cluster details page. ClickÂ **Cluster Details**  to view information about a cluster such as the configurations, deployed nodes, and other basic information.
-   **[Viewing Patch Information About an Active Cluster](viewing-patch-information-about-an-active-cluster.md)**  
You can view patch information about cluster components. If a cluster component, such as Hadoop or Spark, is abnormal, download the patch. Then choose  **Clusters \> Active Clusters**. Select a cluster and click its name to switch the cluster details page to upgrade the component to resolve the problem.

-   **[Expanding a Cluster](expanding-a-cluster.md)**  
The storage and computing capabilities of MRS can be improved by simply adding Core nodes or Task nodes instead of modifying system architecture, reducing O&M costs. Core nodes can process and store data. You can add Core nodes to increase the number of nodes that process the peak load. Task nodes are used for computing and do not store persistent data.
-   **[Shrinking a Cluster](shrinking-a-cluster.md)**  
You can reduce Core nodes or Task nodes based on service requirements to shrink a cluster so that MRS has better storage and computing capabilities at lower O&M costs.

-   **[Terminating a Cluster](terminating-a-cluster.md)**  
If you do not need an MRS cluster after the job execution is complete, you can terminate the MRS cluster. 
-   **[Deleting a Failed Task](deleting-a-failed-task.md)**  
This section describes how to delete a failed MRS task.

-   **[Managing Data Files](managing-data-files.md)**  
After Kerberos authentication is disabled, you can create directories, delete directories, and import, export, or delete files on the  **Files**  page.
-   **[Viewing the Alarm List](viewing-the-alarm-list.md)**  
The alarm list provides information about all alarms in the MRS cluster. Examples of alarms include host faults, disk usage exceeding the threshold, and component abnormalities.
