MRS, capable of processing and storing massive sets of data, supports the following features:

-   Enhanced open-source Hadoop software
-   Spark in-memory computing engine
-   HBase distributed storage database
-   Hive data warehouse
-   Hue web framework

It also supports cluster management. To meet service requirements, you should specify the node quantity and data disk space when applying for MRS. Then you need only focus on data analysis.

-   **[Cluster Management Function](cluster-management-function.md)**  
This section describes the Web interface functions of MRS clusters.
-   **[Hadoop](hadoop.md)**  
MRS deploys and hosts Apache Hadoop clusters in the cloud to provide services featuring high availability and enhanced reliability for big data processing and analysis.
-   **[Spark](spark.md)**  
Spark is a distributed and parallel data processing framework. MRS deploys and hosts Apache Spark clusters in the cloud.
-   **[Spark SQL](spark-sql.md)**  
Spark SQL is an important component of Apache Spark and subsumes Shark. It helps engineers unfamiliar with MapReduce to get started quickly. Users can enter SQL statements directly to analyze, process, and query data.
-   **[HBase](hbase.md)**  
HBase is a column-oriented distributed cloud storage system. It features enhanced reliability, excellent performance, and elastic scalability.
-   **[Hive](hive.md)**  
Hive is a data warehouse framework built on Hadoop. It stores structured data using the Hive query language \(HiveQL\), a language similar to SQL.
