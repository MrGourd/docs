-   Flexible configuration

    You can create VPCs, add subnets, specify IP address ranges, and configure DHCP and route tables. You can create ECSs that are in different availability zones \(AZs\), in the same VPC.

-   Secure and reliable

    A VPC is completely and logically isolated from other VPCs using the tunneling technology. By default, different VPCs cannot communicate with each other. Firewalls are provided to protect subnets, and security groups are provided to protect ECSs. The firewalls and security groups add additional layers of security to your VPC, making your network more secure.

-   Interconnection

    By default, a VPC cannot access the Internet. You can leverage elastic IP addresses \(EIPs\), Elastic Load Balancing \(ELB\) functions, NAT gateways, Virtual Private Network \(VPN\) connections, and Direct Connect connections to enable access to the Internet.

    By default, two VPCs cannot communicate with each other. You can create a VPC peering connection to enable the two VPCs to communicate with each other using private IP addresses.

    Multiple connectivity options are provided to meet enterprises' diverse service requirements for the cloud, to allow you to deploy enterprise applications with ease, and to lower enterprise IT operation and maintenance \(O&M\) costs.

-   High-speed access

    Dynamic BGP is used to provide access to various carrier networks. For example, dynamic BGP connections to about 21 carrier networks are provided in China. The dynamic BGP connections enable real-time failover based on the preset routing protocols, ensuring high network stability, low network latency, and smooth access to services on the cloud.
