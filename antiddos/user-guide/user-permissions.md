# User Permissions<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0204851498"></a>

The public cloud system provides two types of permissions by default: user management and resource management.

-   User management refers to the management of users, user groups, and user group rights.
-   Resource management refers to the control operations that can be performed by users on cloud service resources.

For permissions of Anti-DDoS users, see  [Permissions](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/permissions/index.html).
