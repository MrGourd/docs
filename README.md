# README

## Introduction
This Git repository provides you with Open Telekom Cloud (OTC) service documents, including user guides and API references, to help you better understand and use OTC services.

## Directory structure
Documents are stored according to the following rules:
- The level-1 directory (Github.com/OpenTelekomCloud/docs) is the main entry for OTC service documents.
- Level-2 directories are named after service abbreviations such as "ecs" and "vpc".
- Level-3 directories are named after document names such as "user-guide".
- Level-4 and sub -directories contain topics and graphs of a document.
   A .md file contains content of each topic and is named after a topic name. Words are separated by hyphens (-) in a .md file name. Among the .md files, index.md is the directory index file of a document.

Example:

 Github.com/OpenTelekomCloud/docs
 
 ```
