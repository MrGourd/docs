### Accessing ECSs

The public cloud provides a web-based service management platform. You can
access ECSs through HTTPS-compliant application programming interfaces (APIs) or
the management console. These two access modes differ as follows:

-   Accessing ECSs through APIs

    Use this mode if you are required to integrate the ECSs on the public cloud into a third-party system for secondary development. For detailed operations, see
    **Elastic Cloud Server API Reference**.

-   Accessing ECSs through the management console

    Use this mode if you are not required to integrate ECSs with a third-party system. After registering on the public cloud, log in to the management console and click **Elastic Cloud Server** under **Computing** on the homepage.
