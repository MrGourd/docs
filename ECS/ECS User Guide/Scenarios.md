## Scenarios

Public cloud ECSs allow you to obtain public cloud-based ECS resources within
minutes. These resources are elastic and can be scaled up or down based on your
requirements, and they are available worldwide over the Internet. As such, you
can affordably rent required computing and storage resources. This significantly
reduces hardware cost and relieves you of non-service concerns, such as server
capabilities and EVS disk capacity.

### General-Purpose ECSs

-   Applications

    General-purpose ECSs are suitable for applications that have no special
    requirements on CPU performance, memory, disk capacity, or bandwidth, but have high requirements on security and reliability. They feature low initial
    investment and maintenance costs.

-   Application scenarios

    Enterprise website deployment, enterprise office environment setup, enterprise R&D and testing activities, Web servers, R&D and testing environments for developers, and small-scale databases

### Memory-optimized ECSs

-   Applications

    Memory-optimized ECSs are suitable for applications that process large volumes of data and require a large amount of memory, rapid data switching and processing, and low-latency storage resources.

-   Application scenarios

    Big data analysis, precision advertising, e-commerce big data analysis, IoV big data analysis, relational databases, NoSQL databases, and memory data analysis.

### Large-Memory ECSs

-   Applications

    Large-memory ECSs are suitable for applications that require a large amount of memory, rapid data switching, and low latency, and process large volumes of data.

-   Application scenarios

    In-memory databases and big data processing

### High-Performance ECSs

-   Applications

    High-performance ECSs are suitable for applications that require a large number of parallel computing resources and high-performance infrastructure services to meet computing and storage requirements and ensure high rendering efficiency.

-   Application scenarios

    Computing and storage systems for genetic engineering, games, animations,
    biopharmaceuticals, and scientific computing

### GPU-optimized ECSs

-   Applications

    GPU-optimized ECSs are suitable for applications that have high requirements on graphics processing, require large memory and rapid data switching and processing, and process large volumes of data.

-   Application scenarios

    Workload and general-purpose GPU computing

### Disk-intensive ECSs

-   Applications

    Disk-intensive ECSs are suitable for applications that process large volumes of data and require high I/O performance and rapid data switching and processing.

-   Application scenarios

    Big data computing, network file systems, data processing, MapReduce, Hadoop,
    and data-intensive computing
