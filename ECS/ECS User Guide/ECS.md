### ECS

Elastic Cloud Server (ECS) is a computing server consisting of CPUs, memory, images, and Elastic Volume Service (EVS) disks that allow on-demand allocation and elastic scaling. ECSs integrate Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), virtual firewalls, and multi-data-copy capabilities to create an efficient, reliable, and secure computing environment. This ensures stable and uninterrupted operation of services. After creating an ECS, you can use it like using your local computer or physical server.

ECSs support self-service creation, modification, and operation. You can create ECSs by specifying the CPU, memory, image specifications, and login
authentication mode. After creating an ECS, you can modify its specifications as required.
