## VPC

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows you to create customized virtual networks in
your logically isolated AZ on the public cloud. Such networks are dedicated
zones that are logically isolated for your ECSs. You can define security groups,
virtual private networks (VPNs), IP address segments, and bandwidth for a VPC.
This facilitates internal network configuration and management as well as secure
and convenient network modification. You can also customize the ECS access rules
within a security group and between security groups to strengthen ECS security
protection. For more information, see ***Virtual Private Cloud User Guide***.
