ECSs support the following types of EVS disks for storing data:


<ul>
<li>EVS disk with ultra-high I/O</li>
<dd>Uses solid state disk (SSD) drives. They provide ultra-high I/O and low latency, supporting Not Only SQL (NoSQL)/Relational Database Service (RDS) and data warehouse applications.<dd>
<li>EVS disk with high I/O</li>
<dd>Uses serial attached SCSI (SAS) drives. They provide high I/O and low latency, supporting NoSQL/RDS, data warehouse, and file system applications.</dd>
<li>EVS disk with common I/O</li>
<dd>Uses Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) drives. They provide reliable block storage and support key applications.</dd></ul>

EVS disks with different I/O capacities provide different features at different
prices. Choose EVS disks based on your requirements. For more information about
