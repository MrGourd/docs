# Creating a User Group<a name="en-us_topic_0046611269"></a>

You can plan user groups based on users' responsibilities and grant them the corresponding permissions. Users in a user group have all of its permissions. User groups help improve the efficiency of permission management.

## Procedure<a name="section30804749"></a>

1.  In the navigation pane, choose  **User Groups**.
2.  On the  **User Groups**  page, click  **Create User Group**.
3.  Enter a user group name.
4.  \(Optional\) Set  **Description**.

    >![](/images/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >It is recommended that you set  **Description**  for a user group. For example, if you grant the  **Security Administrator**  permission to a user group, you can add a description to enable users to directly view their permissions and permission details. You can add a custom description or the following description to the  **Description**  text box:  **Security Administrator: has the rights to create, delete, and modify users as well as grant permissions to users.**  For details about the permissions, see  [Permission Description](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/permissions/index.html).  

5.  Click  **OK**.

    The user group list is displayed, including the newly created user group.

6.  Click  **Modify**  in the  **Operation**  column of the row that contains the newly created user group.
7.  In the  **User Group Permissions**  area, click  **Modify**  in the  **Operation**  column of the row that contains the target project.

    >The permissions granted to the user group only take effect for the current project. If you need to grant the permissions for multiple projects to the user group, you must grant permissions for each project individually by clicking  **Modify**  in the row that contains the corresponding project.
