# User Permissions<a name="vpcep_01_0010"></a>

The cloud system provides two types of user permissions by default, user management and resource management.

-   User management refers to management of users, user groups, and user group permissions.
-   Resource management refers to control of operations on cloud service resources.

VPCEP provides two types of resources: VPC endpoint services and VPC endpoints, both of which are region-level resources. The required permissions must be added for users in the project.
