## What Is a Quota?<a name="en-us_topic_0118499026_section6321311611"></a>

A quota limits the quantity of a resource available to users, thereby preventing spikes in the usage of the resource. For example, a VPC quota limits the number of VPCs that can be created.

You can also request for an increase in quota if an existing quota cannot meet your service requirements.

    The  **Service Quota**  page is displayed.

The system does not support online quota adjustment. If you need to adjust a quota, call the hotline or send an email to the customer service mailbox. Customer service personnel will timely process your request for quota adjustment and inform you of the real-time progress by making a call or sending an email.

Before dialing the hotline number or sending an email, make sure that the following information has been obtained:

-   Domain name, project name, and project ID, which can be obtained by performing the following operations:

    Log in to the management console using the cloud account, click the username in the upper right corner, select  **My Credentials**  from the drop-down list, and obtain the domain name, project name, and project ID on the  **My Credentials**  page.

-   Quota information, which includes:
    -   Service name
    -   Quota type
    -   Required quota
