Before You Start
================

Public cloud APIs comply with the RESTful API design principles. REST-based Web
services are organized into resources. Each resource is identified by one or
more Uniform Resource Identifiers \(URIs\). An application accesses a resource
based on the resource's Unified Resource Locator \(URL\). A URL is usually in
the following format:  `https://Endpoint/uri <https://endpoint/uri>`_. In the
URL,  **uri**  indicates the resource path, that is, the API access path.

Public cloud APIs use HTTPS as the transmission protocol. Requests/Responses
are transmitted by using JSON messages, with media type represented by
**Application/json**.

For details about how to use APIs, see `API Usage Guidelines
<../user-guide/index.html>`_.
