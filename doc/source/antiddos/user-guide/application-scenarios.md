Anti-DDoS defends only EIPs against DDoS attacks.

Anti-DDoS devices are deployed at egresses of data centers.  [Figure 1](#fig5732364017363)  shows the network topology.

The detection center detects network access traffic according to user-configured security policies. If an attack is detected, data is diverted to cleaning devices for real-time defense. Abnormal traffic is cleaned, and normal traffic is forwarded.
