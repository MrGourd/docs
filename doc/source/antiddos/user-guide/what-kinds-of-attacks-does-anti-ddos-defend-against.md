    Such as SYN flood, HTTP flood, Challenge Collapsar \(CC\), and slow-connection attacks

-   Game attacks

    Such as User Datagram Protocol \(UDP\) flood, SYN flood, Transmission Control Protocol \(TCP\), and fragment attacks

-   HTTPS server attacks

    Such as SSL DoS and DDoS attacks

-   DNS server attacks

    Such as attacks targeted at vulnerabilities in the Domain Name Server \(DNS\) protocol stack, DNS reflection attacks, DNS flood attacks, and DNS cache-miss attacks
