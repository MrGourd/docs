## What Is Quota?<a name="section763325110543"></a>

Quotas are enforced for service resources on the platform to prevent unforeseen spikes in resource usage. Quotas can limit the number or amount of resources available to users, for example, how many AS groups you can create. You can apply for increasing quotas if necessary.

This section describes how to view the usage of each type of AS resource and the total quotas in a specified region.
