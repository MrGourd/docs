Direct Connect
==============

A Direct Connect is a service that allows you to establish a dedicated network
connection from your data center to the public cloud platform. You can
establish a private connection between the public cloud platform and your data
center, office, or collocation environment, which can reduce your network
latency and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based
connections.
