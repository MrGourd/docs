RDS supports DB instance  backups and restorations  to ensure data reliability.

## Automated Backup<a name="section745745720113"></a>

Automatic backups  are created during the backup period of your DB instances. RDS saves automated backups based on the retention period you specified. If necessary, you can restore to any point in time during your backup retention period.

## Manual Backup<a name="section597119152129"></a>

Manual backups  are user-initiated full backups of DB instances. They are retained until you delete them manually.
