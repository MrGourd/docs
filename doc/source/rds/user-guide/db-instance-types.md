# DB Instance Types<a name="rds_01_0016"></a>

The minimum management unit of RDS is the DB instance. A DB instance is an isolated database environment in the cloud. A DB instance can contain multiple user-created databases, and you can access it by using the same tools and applications that you use with a stand-alone DB instance. You can create and modify DB instances using the management console or APIs. RDS does not have limits on the number of running DB instances. Each DB instance has a DB instance identifier.

DB instances are the smallest management units used by RDS. Each is an isolated database environment on the cloud and can be classified as one of the following:

-   Single DB instances
-   Primary/standby DB instances
-   Read replicas

Only Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Enterprise Edition supports read replicas. Other editions of Microsoft SQL Server do not support read replicas.

You can use RDS to create and manage DB instances running various DB engines.

For details about differences and function comparison between different instance types, see  [DB Instance Introduction](db-instance-introduction.md)  and  [Function Comparison](function-comparison.md).
