# Overview<a name="rds_connect_sqlserver"></a>

This section describes how to create a Microsoft SQL Server DB instance on the management console and bind an EIP to the DB instance to make the instance publicly accessible.

If you are using RDS for the first time, see the constraints described in section  [Microsoft SQL Server Constraints](microsoft-sql-server-constraints.md).

-   [Step 1: Create a DB instance.](step-1-create-a-db-instance-(Microsoft-SQL-Server).md)  Confirm the specifications, storage, network, and database account configurations of the Microsoft SQL Server DB instances based on service requirements.
-   [Step 2: Configure security group rules.](step-2-configure-security-group-rules-(Microsoft-SQL-Server).md)  To access an RDS DB instance from resources outside the security group, you need to configure an  **inbound rule**  for the security group associated with the RDS DB instance.
-   [Step 3: Bind an EIP.](step-3-bind-an-eip-(Microsoft-SQL-Server).md)  The EIP service provides independent public IP addresses and bandwidth for Internet access. You can apply for an EIP on the VPC console and bind the EIP to the RDS DB instance.
-   [Step 4: Connect to a DB instance from a public network.](step-4-connect-to-a-db-instance-through-a-public-network-(Microsoft-SQL-Server).md)  You can use SQL Server Management Studio to connect to a DB instance through a common connection or an SSL connection. The  SSL connection encrypts data  and is more secure.
