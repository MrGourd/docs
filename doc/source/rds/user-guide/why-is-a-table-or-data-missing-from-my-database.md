# Why Is a Table or Data Missing from My Database?<a name="rds_faq_0012"></a>

RDS does not delete or perform any operations on any user data. If this problem occurs, check whether a misoperation has been performed. Restore the data using backup files, if necessary.

Possible solutions are as follows:

-   Use the RDS restoration function to restore data.
-   Import the backup data to RDS through the ECS.
