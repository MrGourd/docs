OBS supports the following permission control mechanisms:

-   IAM policies:  IAM policies  define the actions that can be performed on your cloud resources. In other words,  IAM policies  specify what actions are allowed or denied.
-   Bucket policies and object policies:

    A bucket policy is attached to a bucket and objects in the bucket. By leveraging bucket policies, the owner of a bucket can authorize IAM users or other accounts the permissions to operate the bucket and objects in the bucket.

    An object policy applies to specified objects in a bucket.

-   Access control lists \(ACLs\): Control the read and write permissions for accounts. You can set ACLs for buckets and objects.
