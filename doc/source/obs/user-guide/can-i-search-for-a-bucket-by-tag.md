# Can I Search for a Bucket by Tag?<a name="obs_03_0039"></a>

Searching for buckets by tag is not supported by OBS. However, you can use Tag Management Service \(TMS\) to search for buckets by tag. For details, see  [Searching for Cloud Resources](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/usermanual/tms/en-us_topic_0056266264.html). Select  **OBS-Bucket**  for  **Resource Type**.
