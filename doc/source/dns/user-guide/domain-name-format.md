# Domain Name Format<a name="en-us_topic_0057773604"></a>

A valid domain name meets the following requirements:

-   A domain name contains only letters, digits, and hyphens \(-\) and cannot start or end with a hyphen.
-   A domain name segment cannot exceed 63 characters.
-   Every two segments are separated using a dot \(.\), and the total length of a domain name, including the dot added at the end by default, cannot exceed 254 characters.

For example, **example.com** and **www.example.com** are valid domain names.
