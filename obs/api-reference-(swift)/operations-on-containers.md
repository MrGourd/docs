# Operations on Containers<a name="obs_03_0028"></a>

The requests that are sent by users to OBS must comply with REST specifications and contain required header parameters. If a request is successfully processed, OBS \(compatible with OpenStack Swift\) returns a success response. If the request fails to be processed, OBS \(compatible with OpenStack Swift\) returns a message that contains the cause of the error. This chapter describes REST operations on containers. Authentication is implemented based on IAM.
