# Identity and Access Management<a name="iam_01_0026"></a>

Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) provides identity authentication, permissions management, and access control. With IAM, you can create users for employees, systems, and applications in your enterprise and grant permissions to these users to manage your resources. Each user has their own security credentials and you do not need to share your password or access keys with them. Security policies can be configured to ensure account security and eliminate information security risks.

IAM is free of charge, so you only need to pay for the resources in your domain.
