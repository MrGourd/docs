# Managing a Project<a name="en-us_topic_0066738518"></a>

Projects are used to group and isolate OpenStack resources, including computing, storage, and network resources. Resources in your account must be mounted under projects. A project can be a department or a project team. Access IAM with a security administrator to create projects in a region and perform isolated management of resources.
