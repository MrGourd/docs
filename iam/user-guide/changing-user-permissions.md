# Changing User Permissions<a name="en-us_topic_0080335069"></a>

You can use the following methods to change user permissions:

-   Change the user group of a user on the  **Modify User**  page. This method is used when the permissions of a single user have changed. For details, see  [Viewing and Modifying User Information](viewing-and-modifying-user-information.md).
-   Change the permissions of a user group or change the users included in the user group. This method is used when adding or deleting multiple users from a user group. For details, see  [Viewing and Modifying User Group Information](viewing-and-modifying-user-group-information.md).
