# Domain Name Resolution<a name="en-us_topic_0035920135"></a>

When users need to access servers on the Internet, IP addresses are required. However, it is hard to memorize IP addresses. Domain names easy to memorize are used to identify IP addresses. After registering a domain name, you get the right to use it but users cannot access the website, send or receive emails using your domain name until the name is resolved. Domain name resolution is to map domain names to IP addresses. To access a website on the Internet, visitors only need to enter a domain name in the browser address bar, instead of an IP address. There are two types of domain name resolutions:

-   Forward resolution: to translate domain names into IP addresses. If not specifically noted, domain name resolution mentioned in this document indicate forward resolution.
-   Reverse resolution: to translate IP addresses into domain names based on PTR records.
