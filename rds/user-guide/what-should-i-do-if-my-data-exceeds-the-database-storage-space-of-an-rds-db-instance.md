# What Should I Do If My Data Exceeds the Database Storage Space of an RDS DB Instance?<a name="rds_faq_0046"></a>

## Scenario<a name="s25c0037f44e949eb9cf9f35d738d5659"></a>

The database storage space of an RDS DB instance is exhausted, and applications cannot read data from or write data to databases, interrupting services.

## Cause<a name="s42c64cecac5e44fb8c1e861756a65925"></a>

1.  Data occupies a great amount of storage space.
2.  A large number of binlog files are generated due to a large number of transactions and write operations.
3.  A large number of temporary files are generated due to a large number of sorting queries executed by applications.

## Solution<a name="s6c2eb39a04f14892bad65c0708ec3022"></a>

1.  If data occupies too much storage space, run  **DROP**,  **TRUNCATE**, or  **DELETE**+**OPTIMIZE TABLE**  to delete useless historical table data to release storage space. If no historical data can be deleted, scale up your storage space.
2.  If binlog files occupy too much storage space, contact technical support to delete local binlog files to release storage space.
3.  If temporary files generated by sorting queries occupy too much storage space, optimize your SQL query statements.
4.  If the preceding solutions are invalid, implement database and table sharding.
