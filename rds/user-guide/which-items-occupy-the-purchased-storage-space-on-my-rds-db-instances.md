# Which Items Occupy the Purchased Storage Space on My RDS DB Instances?<a name="rds_faq_0047"></a>

Both your common data \(excluding backup data\) and the data required for the operation of your DB instances \(such as system database data, rollback logs, redo logs, and indexes\) occupies the storage space on your purchased RDS DB instances. The following RDS log files also occupy storage space:

-   Binlog log files generated by MySQL databases
-   Logs files generated by PostgreSQL database servers
-   Log files, including Microsoft SQL Server logs, default Microsoft SQL Server Trace logs, and Microsoft SQL Server Agent logs, generated by Microsoft SQL Server databases.

These files are necessary to ensure the stable operation of RDS DB instances.
