# Does MySQL Support SSL Connections?<a name="rds_faq_0070"></a>

MySQL supports SSL connections. Different from other vendors, RDS for MySQL enables the SSL connection on the database server by default. When you use a client to connect to MySQL DB instances, you can determine whether to enable SSL as required.

For details about SSL, see section  [Connecting to a MySQL DB Instance Through a Public Network](connecting-to-a-mysql-db-instance-through-a-public-network.md).
