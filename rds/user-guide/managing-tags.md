Tag Management Service \(TMS\)  enables you to use tags on the management console to manage resources. TMS works with other cloud services to manage tags. TMS manages tags globally, and other cloud services manage their own tags.

-   You are advised to set predefined tags on the TMS console.
-   A tag consists of a key and value. You can add only one value for each key.
-   A maximum of 20 tags can be added for each DB instance.
