# What Will Monitoring Metrics for an AS Group Be Affected If OTC tools Are Not Installed on ECSs?<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0063511433"></a>

If OTC tools have not been installed on ECSs, Cloud Eye can monitor the Outband Incoming Rate and Outband Outgoing Rate. However, it cannot monitor the Memory Usage,  Inband Incoming Rate, and Inband Outgoing Rate, which reduces data accuracy of the CPU usage.

For details about monitoring metrics supported by AS, see  [Table 1](as-and-other-services.md#en-us_topic_0190954097_table1856812418720).

If OTC Tools are not installed on ECSs, AS cannot obtain the memory usage, inband incoming rate, and inband outgoing rate.
