1.  Log in to the management console.
2.  Under  **Management & Deployment**, click  **Cloud Eye**.

4.  On the  **Alarm Rules**  page, click  **Create Alarm Rule**.

    The following describes how to create an alarm rule for an enhanced load balancer:

    1.  Select  **Elastic Load Balance**  for  **Resource Type**.
    2.  Select  **Enhanced Load Balancer**  for  **Dimension**. You can also select  **Listener**.
    3.  Click  **Select**  to select an enhanced load balancer that you want to monitor.
    4.  Set other parameters as required and then click  **OK**.

        Once the alarm rule is set and you have enabled the notification function, the system automatically sends you a notification when an alarm that complies with the alarm rule is generated.
