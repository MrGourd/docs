# Load Balancer Migration Wizard<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0118977675"></a>

After enhanced load balancers are rolled out, you may want to replace your classic load balancers with enhanced load balancers to better fit your requirements.

Classic load balancers are different from enhanced load balancers in the use and functions, so not all classic load balancers can be used as enhanced load balancers. Therefore, a migration wizard is provided to help you determine which classic load balancers can be migrated. With this tool, you can create enhanced load balancers based on existing classic load balancers within a few clicks and delete existing classic load balancers.
