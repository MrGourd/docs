Both types of load balancers have the following advantages:

-   High Performance

    ELB can process up to 100 million concurrent connections, meeting your requirement to handle a large number of access requests.

-   High Availability

    ELB is deployed in cluster mode and provides fault tolerance for your applications by automatically balancing traffic across multiple AZs.

-   Flexible Expansion

    Incoming traffic is intelligently distributed to ECSs. ELB can work with Auto Scaling \(AS\) to flexibly expand the service capabilities of your applications.

-   Easy to Use

    ELB can be quickly deployed, and diverse protocols and algorithms are available, enabling you to easily configure load distribution policies for different scenarios.


Enhanced load balancers also have the following highlights:

-   Higher Reliability

    Both public and private network load balancers support cross-AZ load balancing. The consistent hashing algorithm makes the traffic distribution more balanced.

-   Easier O&M

    ELB allows you to monitor your applications and their performance in real time with Cloud Eye metrics at the granularity of an individual listener.
