# Why Do My DCS Instances Sometimes Become Unavailable While They Are in Running State?<a name="en-us_topic_0077673452"></a>

The most probable cause is a network fault. To locate the fault, perform the following steps:

1.  Log in to the DCS console.
2.  In the navigation pane, choose  **Cache Manager**.
3.  In the same row as the DCS instance whose metrics you want to view, click  **View Metric**.
4.  View monitoring metrics of the DCS instance.
    -   If monitoring metrics change dramatically over a certain period of time, a network fault has occurred. After the network administrator rectifies the problem, reconnect to the DCS instance or perform management operations on the DCS instance again.
    -   If all monitoring metrics fall within the acceptable range, contact technical support.
