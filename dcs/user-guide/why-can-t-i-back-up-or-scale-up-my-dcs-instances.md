# Why Can't I Back Up or Scale Up My DCS Instances?<a name="en-us_topic_0072544388"></a>

-   Only master/standby and Proxy Cluster DCS instances can be backed up and restored. Single-node DCS instances do not support backup or restoration.
-   DCS instance backup and scale-up are new functions provided by DCS. If your DCS instances were created long time ago, the version of these DCS instances is not upgraded and therefore cannot support some new functions \(such as DCS instance backup and scale-up\). You can contact technical support personnel to upgrade your DCS instance version. After the upgrade, you can back up and scale up your DCS instances.
