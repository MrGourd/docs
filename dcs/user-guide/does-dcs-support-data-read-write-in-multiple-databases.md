# Does DCS Support Data Read/Write in Multiple Databases?<a name="en-us_topic_0071964265"></a>

Both single-node and master/standby DCS instances support data read/write in multiple databases. By default, single-node and master/standby DCS instances can read and write data in 256 databases \(databases 0â€“255\).

DCS instances in Proxy Cluster mode do not support data read/write in multiple databases.
