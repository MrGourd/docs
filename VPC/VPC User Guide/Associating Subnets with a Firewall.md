	Subnets that have already been associated with firewalls will not be displayed on the page for you to select. Currently, one-click subnet association and disassociation are not supported. Furthermore, a subnet can only be associated with one firewall. If you want to reassociate a subnet that has already been associated with another firewall, you must first disassociate the subnet from the original firewall.
