## Releasing an ECS Private IP Address

### Scenarios

release it to avoid resource occupation.

The private IP address that has been bound to an ECS, gateway, or DHCP server
cannot be deleted.

3.  On the console homepage, under **Network**, click **Virtual Private Cloud**.

4.  In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Virtual Private Cloud**.

5.  On the **Subnet** page, locate the target subnet, and click **Manage Private
    IP Address**.

6.  Select the private IP address to be released from the IP address list and
    click **Delete**.

7.  Click **OK**.
