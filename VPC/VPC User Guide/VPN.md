## VPN

A virtual private network (VPN) establishes an encrypted communication tunnel between a remote user and a VPC, enabling the remote user to use service resources in the VPC through the VPN.

By default, ECSs in a VPC cannot communicate with your physical data center or private network. To enable communication between them, you can create a VPN.
