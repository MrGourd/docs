## Accessing the VPC

Web-based service management platforms, including the management console and
HTTPS-based application programming interface (API), are provided for you to
access the VPC service. The detailed methods for accessing the VPC service are
as follows:

-   API

	If you need to integrate the VPC service in the public cloud system into a third-party system for secondary development, use the API to access the VPC	 service. For details, see the ***Virtual Private Cloud API Reference***.

-   Management console

	You can log in to the management console to perform other required operations on the VPC service. If you have signed up for an account in the public cloud system, you can access the VPC service by signing into the management console and selecting **Virtual Private Cloud** from the console homepage.
