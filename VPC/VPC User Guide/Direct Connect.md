## Direct Connect


Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection between
your data center and the public cloud system. With Direct Connect, you can set
up a dedicated network connection between the public cloud system and your local
data center, office, or collocation environment. This helps reduce network
latency and provides a more consistent and reliable network experience than
Internet-based connections.
