## Changing the Sequence of a Firewall Rule

### Scenarios

If multiple firewall rules conflict, the rules in the front take precedence. If
you need a rule to take effect before or after a specific rule, you can insert
that rule before or after the specific rule.
### Procedure

2.  Log in to the management console.

3.  On the console homepage, under **Network**, click **Virtual Private Cloud**.

4.  In the navigation tree on the left, click **Firewall**.

5.  Locate the target firewall in the right pane, and click the firewall name to
    switch to the page showing details of that particular firewall.

6.  On the displayed page, click the **Inbound** tab.

7.  In the **Inbound** area, locate the target firewall rule, click **More** in
    the **Operation** column, and select **Insert Above** or **Insert Below**.

8.  In the displayed dialog box, configure required parameters and click **OK**.

	The firewall rule is inserted. The procedure for inserting an outbound firewall rule is the same as that for inserting an inbound firewall rule.
