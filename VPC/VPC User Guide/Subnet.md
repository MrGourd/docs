## Subnet

A subnet is a network that manages ECS network planes. It supports IP address management and the DNS service. The IP addresses of all ECSs in a subnet belong to this subnet.

By default, ECSs in all subnets of the same VPC can communicate with one another, while ECSs in different VPCs cannot communicate with one another.

You can create VPC peering connections to enable ECSs in different VPCs to communicate with one another. For details, see section <a href="VPC Peering Connection.md">VPC Peering Connection</a>.
