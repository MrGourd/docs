## Security Group

A security group is a collection of access control rules for ECSs that have the same security protection requirements and are mutually trusted in a VPC. After a security group is created, you can create different access rules for the security group to protect the ECSs that are added to this security group. The default security group rule allows all outgoing data packets. ECSs in a security group can access each other without the need to add rules.
