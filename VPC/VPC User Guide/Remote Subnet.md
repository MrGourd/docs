## Remote Subnet

A remote subnet is the destination network reachable through the tunnel. All IP packets sent to the network are transmitted through the IPsec VPN tunnel. You can configure more than one remote subnet. The remote subnet of a VPN cannot be a subnet in the VPC where the VPN is created.
